If you're reading this, that means I'm officially finished with sprint 1 & have passed project 1.
￼

We began on 8/31. It took me 1 week to complete all of the theory/practice exercises & about 2 weeks & some change to complete my project.
Moving forward, I'll need to pick up the pace as I'll only have about 1 week for theory & 1 week to complete the project. I'm grateful that this first one was a little longer - it gave me an idea of how to make better use of my time.

Now for the good stuff. How did it go for me overall?

## A LANDING PAGE IS EASY ENOUGH, RIGHT?

Famous last words. I thought project 1 would go more smoothly for me since it's just a "simple" landing page. Oh, I was wrong.
Project 1 consisted of 6 pretty straightforward sections. We were provided an extremely detailed design brief (I wonder if this is the case in the real world?!).

## WHERE I RAN INTO ISSUES

- BEM Methodology - Learning a completely new way of organizing & structuring code has been a struggle. I was already struggling with CSS enough as it is, and then I have to learn how to organize something I don't even understand?! I think maybe I expected too much of myself at this point, but assigning appropriate classes to elements & their corresponding modifiers was hell for me. I'm sure that this will only get better with time & something I will need to review with every project moving forward.
- Not breaking down the problem - I ran into a LOT of issues with spacing, especially when it came to creating the table layouts for two of the sections. In fact, I struggled with every last section of the page. I got overwhelmed to the point where I couldn't even explain (to myself) what was going on. I kept looking at the whole & not the pieces. What ended up working for me was tackling each section's HTML first & then styling that section before moving on. I'm not sure if this is best practice, but it helped me to break down those pieces into manageable chunks.

  Me literally uncommenting code as I go along. It was more tedious but I ended up finding the things I needed to fix!

- Not knowing how to even ask a question - I guess if I can't break down the problem for myself, it's dang near impossible to try to explain it to someone else in order to get help.
- Divs where I didn't need divs - Once I began to break apart each section to try & figure out why my styling properties were not working, I realized through trial & error that I wrapped elements in divs that were unnecessary. Once I got rid of those & (most) of my styles began to work, I almost cried. I had literally spent days trying to figure out what I was doing wrong because I was doing my best to follow the specs in the brief exactly.

## WHAT HELPED ME

- Stepping away from the code for a while - Luckily, this sprint 1 is the longest so I've had the luxury of extra time to do this multiple times but walking away from my computer to eat, exercise, sleep (or whatever) helped tremendously to clear my head & get my back on track.
- Taking advantage of our Slack community (duh!) - This one may seem obvious but there were several times when I had lots of questions but I was afraid to come across as stupid or asking too many questions & therefore hogging up all the space for others. However, that's what the community is for. There are no stupid questions & others can learn from my questions & vice versa.

I'll be back with specific breakdowns of HTML/CSS theory that I've learned so far, but I wanted to give an update on what's been going on so far.
