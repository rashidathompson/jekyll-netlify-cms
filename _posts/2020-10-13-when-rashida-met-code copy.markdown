Hi. It’s me…Rashida. I’m a single coparenting mom of one super sassy almost 5 year old. I work full-time in digital analytics. I’m learning to code part-time so I can FINALLY switch careers.
The crazy thing is…I’ve been doing this coding thing for a while. Well, off and on.

## When Rashida met code

It all started with WordPress. If I remember correctly, I started my very first blog around 2011 in an effort to hop on the personal branding/online presence explosion when the digital space was really starting to pop.

I went from WordPress.com to self-hosted WordPress, and as much as I loved writing, I ended up getting distracted while playing around with the theme customizations.

Fast forward a few years & a few attempts at lifestyle blogging, enter the learning to code movement.

## It's getting serious

2014 is when I really got into learning how to code. I began attending all kinds of tech meetups in Atlanta (Women Who Code, Rails Girls, etc), started my Twitter account & began to network. In fact, I’m still connected with quite a few folks from the Atlanta tech community. Hey, y’all!

From HTML to CSS to Ruby to JavaScript, I was exposed to it all. I was in tutorial heaven (not hell). Free courses, paid courses…YOU NAME IT. Yet I felt like I was going nowhere fast.

Then I became a mother in 2015. My life changed in ways both good & not so good. I struggled with postpartum depression, a sucky relationship & subsequent breakup, a move back to Tennessee & back to Atlanta again.
Needless to say, coding was the last thing on my mind.

## Back for the 1st time

Fast forward to late 2019, the learning to code bug was still biting me. It really never stopped, despite how chaotic my life had become with new motherhood.

I knew that even though nearly 4 years had passed since I was involved in the tech scene, I had to get back. No matter how long it had been or how frustrating learning was.

So here I am. Back to learning. Starting over. I’m studying JavaScript because my goal is to make things for the web.

Still self-learning, still bouncing around courses until something sticks. I’ve been entertaining online part-time bootcamps because I NEED the structure, deadlines & accountability at the same damn time.

I’m waiting to hear back on a scholarship for a bootcamp so stay tuned for updates on that. UPDATE: I got the scholarship!
