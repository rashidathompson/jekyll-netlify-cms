title: "Sprint 2: Nested BEM structure, reusable blocks & animations"

This was the 1st sprint where we actually only had 2 weeks to complete both the theory & the project.
Project 2 was (thankfully) just a continuation of project 1 but still not without its own issues.

What major concepts did we cover this time?

- Forms
- CSS keyframes/animations
- Reusing blocks (& adding in modifiers/mixins as needed)
- Nested BEM file structure

## What went well:

- _Creating the nested BEM structure._ There were _literally_ levels to this. Because there were so many blocks & each block had multiple elements, it was really easy to fall down the rabbit hole with the nested folder & @import at-rules. Once I got the hang of it, I was able to easily set up the remaining folders.
- _Setting up the keyframes._ I found this to be one of the easier tasks this time around & it was also pretty fun. We only had one animation (a rotation for the background images) so the keyframe wasn't very complex. I definitely want to explore animations a little bit more. We didn't get nearly enough of it in this project!
